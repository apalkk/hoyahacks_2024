              Self-Guided Tour
            


Grab your phone and your walking shoes and prepare to see the iconic sights of the University of Maryland (UMD) campus!
If you are visiting our campus during off-hours, when another visit option is not available, or you just happen to be in the College Park area, our audio Terrapin Tour is a great way to experience UMD first-hand.






To take advantage of this convenient self-guided tour, simply download the TERPLife app (for iOS and Android), and search for Terrapin Tour.
In addition to the Terrapin Tour, this app houses a wealth of information pertaining to all aspects of life at UMD such as dining, housing, student activities and clubs, and some of our most frequently asked questions.
As you explore our beautiful campus, feel free to take notes within the app and share your experience on Twitter and Instagram using #BeATerp.
