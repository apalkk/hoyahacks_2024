 Welcome to the Disability Studies Minor
The Disability Studies Minor promotes the study of disability and prepares students for an inclusively designed world. Students enrolled in the DS Minor will examine the concept of disability historically, in contemporary society, and in their chosen fields of study. Through required and elective courses, students will explore challenges and opportunities we face in making our world more accessible to all. Students will study and learn about how culture, education, and technology have shaped and continue to shape our definition and understanding of people with disabilities. 
All undergraduate students regardless of major are invited to apply. While the program is affiliated with special education faculty in the College of Education, the Minor does not prepare students to become special education teachers.  Rather, the Minor is designed to broaden students’ understandings of the concept of disability and facilitate connections to content and concepts within other disciplines on campus.
