BACHELOR OF MUSIC EDUCATION






Breadcrumb


Home











The Bachelor of Music Education (B.M.E.) degree is designed for undergraduate students who desire to embark on a career in K-12 music education.
















With a 100 percent placement rate, our music education alumni are highly sought after throughout the state of Maryland.
This is due to our program’s dedicated faculty and commitment to teacher training. In completing this curriculum, you will become both an exemplary performing musician—our B.M.E. students take the same lessons and ensembles as performance majors—and an educator who thinks critically about teaching and learning in diverse communities. The B.M.E. degree is robust and generally not appropriate for those seeking another degree outside of music. Within music, earning a dual degree in music education (B.M.E.) and music performance (B.M.) is very possible and only takes one additional semester (four-and-a-half years) as you will earn the degrees simultaneously. The dual degree may be the best fit for a student seeking to gain the most performance experience during their time at the University of Maryland. Dual degree students complete eight semesters of coursework, applied private lessons and ensembles, and a final ninth semester dedicated to a full-time student teaching internship.
