The Undergraduate Major in Communication
The Department of Communication offers students the option to pursue Communication Studies or select from one of the following specializations: Health and Science Communication, Media and Digital Communication, Political Communication and Public Advocacy or Public Relations. The course requirements for the different specializations vary and the key to a successful completion of the COMM major requirements is based on planning the appropriate course sequence for your specialization of choice. The major is composed of six parts: Foundations of Communication, Research Methods, Communication and Society (consists of 2 courses: Leadership and Social Change and Diversity and Inclusion), Theory and Principles, 2 Applied courses, and Electives.
A grade of 'C-' or better is required in all courses used to satisfy major requirements.
Update regarding Spring 2020 grades: Due to the impact of COVID-19 on grading methods, we will consider the grade of Pass ("P") as meeting the minimum grade necessary for gateway and major requirements for courses taken in the Spring 2020 semester.
Update regarding Spring 2021 grades: For Spring 2021, students may earn a grade of Pass with a C- or better (students are permitted to take up to 7 credits Pass/D+/D/D-/F). A grade of Pass in Spring 2021 will meet the minimum grade necessary for gateway and major requirements.
