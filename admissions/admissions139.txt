Portuguese Language, Literature and Culture Minor






Breadcrumb

Fields of Study


Portuguese











The Portuguese minor is designed to give students intermediate to advanced language skills, as well as critical thinking tools necessary to understand culturally diverse societies.

















Quick Links

Portuguese Home




The minor consists of 15 credits of coursework beyond the prerequisite courses (PORT103 and PORT203). Students complete intermediate to advanced immersive language courses that prepare them to communicate, understand, read and write in Portuguese. In addition, students also complete coursework focused on several aspects of the culture, literature and cinema of the Portuguese-speaking countries. The interdisciplinary nature of our minor allows students to explore their interests while deepening their capacity to communicate across cultures. 
Why Portuguese?

There are several reasons to learn Portuguese and delve into the Portuguese-speaking cultures:

Portuguese is the 6th most spoken language in the world!
It is the official language of 9 countries located in South America, Africa, Europe, and Asia.
The U.S Department of State classified it as a critical language. ​
Brazil is the 9th largest economy in the world.
Easy to learn for Romance Language speakers (Spanish, French, Italian)
Our classes are small, dynamic and fun.

What to do with a Portuguese Minor?
In addition to rigorous training in Portuguese-speaking language and cultures, our students also develop essential skills on critical thinking, written and verbal expression, cross-cultural awareness and communication. Here are some potential places where these skills can be applied:
The U.S. Department of State; The IMF; The IDB (Inter-American Development Bank); The World Bank; International Non-Profits working with Latin America or African countries; The embassies and Consulates of the 8 Portuguese-Speaking countries in DC. 
Undergraduate students can pursue a minor in Portuguese. We offer special opportunities to:

Deepen linguistic and cultural knowledge through Study Abroad
Practice Portuguese with a native speaker on-campus through the SLLC Language Partner Program
