Romance Languages Program




Italian is the language of modern and contemporary Italy, through which its culture has become known to the world, including the beauty and ramifications of its art, music, poetry, fashion, food and architecture. Italian has also emerged as the language of an industrialized nation playing an active role within the European Union. It is the intent of the Italian program (ITAL) to bring its students to a level of linguistic and cultural understanding that allows them to participate actively in on-going events and conversations connected to the cultural and professional worlds of this dynamic country. The Italian Program offers a range of courses well suited for students who are preparing themselves for graduate study, research, professional development in the varied fields of the humanities and sciences, and those seeking a teaching career in education.

Declaring the Italian Studies Major


We recommend that interested students declare their major as early as possible.

Step 1: Carefully read ITAL major requirements and download the ITAL Major Advising Worksheet.
Step 2: Read through all information carefully and pencil in a sequence of courses on the worksheet to discuss with the program advisor.
Step 3: Contact the Office of Student Affairs at the College of Arts and Humanities (301-405-2108) to make an appointment to discuss the non-Italian aspects of your 4-year-plan (bring signed form from previous step), including CORE courses. Walk-in hours are also available.
Step 4: If you are adding Italian as an additional major, check with your home department and college to identify paperwork you may need to complete.




Advising


The Italian undergraduate advisor is available for consultation about any aspect of your study of Italian. To ensure that you have fulfilled all the requirements for graduation, the department recommends that every Italian major confer with an advisor at registration time each semester.
Office hours are posted in Jiménez 1104 Hall.
