Spanish is one of the world’s great languages of commerce and diplomacy, and has rich literary and cultural traditions. 
Graduates who receive a B.A. in Spanish have a diverse array of opportunities in many different fields, especially those with an international focus, including further specialized studies in literature, language and culture, or careers in other fields such as education, public service, business, law, environmental policies, social services, medicine or the arts. The undergraduate major in Spanish consists of 36 credits of coursework beyond the prerequisite courses, with an additional 9 credits in a supporting area. Students can choose from 3 major tracks, including: 1) Spanish and Latin American Literature, Culture, and Media; 2) Spanish Linguistics, Culture, and Education; and 3) Spanish Language, Culture, and Professional Contexts. To declare a major in Spanish, students should meet with the undergraduate advisor to begin the process. After this advising session, prospective majors will also need advising from the College of Arts And Humanities in 1120 Francis Scott Key.

Courses for Heritage Speakers


The Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers several courses specifically designed for Spanish heritage learners.
 
Spanish heritage learners are students who have a linguistic and cultural connection with the Spanish language. This may be because they come from homes where Spanish is spoken, their heritage is linked to a country or area where Spanish is spoken, or they live or have lived in a community that speaks Spanish.
 
The courses we offer recognize the diverse cultural and linguistic profiles of our students. Our classes can accommodate students who are exposed to Spanish-speaking environments in a variety of social and/or professional environments but understand or speak little Spanish. We can also help Spanish heritage learners who seek to strengthen their skills in professional or academic registers of Spanish. In general, our goal is to help students develop their Spanish skills so they feel more confident when using Spanish in different contexts.
 
Our courses for Spanish heritage learners focus on strengthening and expanding students’ communicative competence in a variety of contexts and texts and fostering an appreciation for and understanding of the cultural and linguistic diversity of the Spanish-speaking world, including the United States.




Study Abroad


All students majoring in Spanish are encouraged to study abroad in a Spanish-speaking environment. The Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers exciting opportunities for Spanish majors and minors to fulfill requirements abroad. See Education Abroad for more information.




Double Major/Double Degree


Many successful students choose to double major in Spanish and another chosen field. If the two majors do not belong to the same college, the requirements of both colleges must be met. The courses for the other major will fulfill the Spanish Supporting Courses requirement. A double major may be earned with completion of all requirements and a total of 120 credits. A double degree may be awarded with completion of all requirements and a total of 150 credits. The student must decide on a primary and a secondary major. Academic decisions for each student are made by the primary college.




Combination of the Spanish Major and Teacher’s Certification


Students may combine the Spanish linguistics option with a second major in foreign language education to earn teacher certification. Students must take the California Achievement Test to become eligible for admission to the College of Education. Information and Declaration of Major Forms can be found in room 1210 of the Benjamin Building. A graduate program in education for teacher certification is available to students who receive a B.A. in Spanish from our department.
