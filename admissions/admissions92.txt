A collaboration between the School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation and the College of Arts and Humanities.
Students in this interdisciplinary minor learn how artists and designers can play a vital role in advancing public dialogue, exploring our shared humanity and addressing some of our major challenges, whether it be sparking conversations about racial injustice, inequitable development, climate change or celebrating the diverse communities and cultures around us. In the Creative Placemaking studios, students will engage in place-based projects in partnership with local creatives, culture bearers and knowledge keepers. This minor currently offers two tracks: one focusing on architecture and spatial practice and the other on the visual arts.

Making ‘Place’ Through Art and Design
“We want our students to engage in a spatial practice that sparks inquiry and fosters relationships in place,” said Eisenbach, who will serve as the program’s director. “This program will help students leverage and expand skills beyond their discipline to build on and strengthen the assets our local communities already have in meaningful ways.”
