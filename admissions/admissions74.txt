Agricultural Science & Technology






Agricultural Sciences and Technology (AGST) is an interdisciplinary major for students who want to learn about sustainable agricultural practices, the cultivation of various crops and educating others through the context of cutting-edge agricultural technology. Students can focus on specializations in Agronomy, Environmental Horticulture or Agricultural & Extension Education.  
Degrees Offered: B.S.
Agricultural Sciences and Technology information


Programs of Study



Agronomy






Agronomy students will be educated in a broad range of agricultural disciplines which will provide them with a comprehensive education in crop, soil and animal sciences. Here at the University of Maryland, the focus of the program will be for students to gain a sustainable perspective of agronomy. Students will take a holistic approach to the design of their course work. This approach will integrate the science of agronomy through studies in areas such as Animal Science, Crop Science, Soil Science, Farm Management, and Pest Management.
Agronomy information





Environmental Horticulture






The Environmental Horticulture specialization (Formerly Plant Sciences: Horticulture and Crop Production) is designed to lead students toward becoming an owner-operator or a manager in fields such as: environmental horticulture; greenhouse management; container nursery production; fresh fruit and vegetable production; and plant protection. For students who have a strong interest in education, numerous possibilities for rewarding careers also exist in agricultural extension, public gardens, and ornamental horticulture.

Agricultural & Extension Education






Agricultural & Extension Education is a University of Maryland program that is a cooperative effort of the College of Agriculture and Natural resources and the College of Education. It is designed to prepare students to teach agriculture and related subjects in high school. Many high schools in Maryland and other states offer an agricultural curriculum that is associated with The National FFA Organization. There are two paths that students can take in preparation for a career as a high school agriculture teacher. Students can double major in Agricultural Science and Technology (AGST) and Secondary Education or students can earn a B.S. degree in AGST and a M.A. degree in education.
