    Most content courses taught in French are not open to fluent or native speakers of French.


    One 400-level course is required for the completion of the minor in French studies.


    All courses must be taught in French.


    A maximum of 6 credits can be applied to the minor from courses taken at other institutions, with the exception of Maryland-in-Nice, which allows the transfer of 9 credits.
