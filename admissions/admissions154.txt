NOTE: To fulfill the requirements for the CPA exam, contact the Board of Accountants in the state where you intend to take the exam. Do not assume requirements for the accounting major are sufficient in all states. For details on various states' CPA requirements visit www.nasba.org.
NOTE: All applicants who wish to take the CPA exam in the state of Maryland must complete 150 credit hours. To view the state of Maryland's CPA requirements visit www.dllr.state.md.us/license/cpa.
Suggested 150 Credit Hour Options
Most states, including Maryland, require a minimum of 150 credit hours of college education to fulfill the education requirements to obtain a CPA license. Students can typically complete their Accounting degree and the specific course requirements for the CPA in the minimum 120 credits required to earn the degree. However, if 150 credits are required to fulfill the education requirements to obtain a CPA license, students must complete 30 credits beyond the specific course requirements to be licensed. These additional credits can be completed in several ways, as illustrated below. Please be sure to consult the Board of Accountants in the state where you intend to take the exam for their specific requirements because requirements can vary between states. For details on various states' CPA requirements visit www.nasba.org.
Graduate Programs
The Smith School offers several specialty master's degrees including one in accounting. Credits from these programs can apply to the 150 credits required for the CPA, and these programs can further enhance your accounting knowledge and skills or provide you more depth in another area of business. In addition, accounting majors can pursue +1 Dual Bachelor's/Master's degrees and take up to 10 credits of graduate credit as an undergraduate at undergraduate tuition rates. In addition, some graduate credits can satisfy undergraduate degree requirements. For more details on these programs visit Business Master’s and Plus 1.
In addition, many institutions offer graduate programs for undergraduate accounting students. Consult institutions in your area about the availability of these types of graduate degrees.
Double Majors/Degrees
Accounting majors can select a second major in or outside of the Smith School. Any credits required to complete the second major, above the 120 minimum required for a degree, can be applied toward the 150 total credits to obtain a CPA license. Students who accumulate 150 credits while completing both majors are eligible to earn two degrees upon their graduation.
Obtain information on majors outside of the Smith School.
Minors
The Smith School of Business currently offers two minors that are open to Smith School students, Business Analytics and Innovation & Entrepreneurship. Additionally, many minors are offered in other departments across the campus.
Smith Undergraduate Fellows Program
The Smith Undergraduate Fellows program is an innovative concept in undergraduate business education, offering a series of special academic programs—or tracks—which will create small communities of scholars within the larger Smith School community. Each specialized fellows program combines opportunities for action learning and professional development with rigorous in-depth academic coursework focused on cutting-edge issues affecting 21st-century business.
Study Abroad Programs (summer, winter and/or semester programs)
Studying abroad is a great way to expand your understanding of other business and cultural environments, and to demonstrate an ability to work effectively in foreign environments. In addition to the campus Education Abroad Office, the Center for Global Business offers exchange programs for Smith School students. Visit the links below for more details on all your program options and for contact information.




















Finance
Smith’s Finance majors learn from faculty with real-world experience, like Professor Lemma Senbet, whose international finance career has influenced policy in Africa and the careers of the students he’s mentored, who include a bank president and a chief economist at the SEC. 
The finance curriculum will familiarize you with the institutions, theory and practice involved in the allocation of financial resources within the private sector. It provides an excellent foundation for careers involving financial analysis and management, investment analysis and portfolio management, investment banking, insurance and risk management, banking, and international finance.
While only MATH120 Elementary Calculus I or MATH140 Calculus I (MATH130 also accepted) is required for the finance major, students with a strong math background are encouraged to complete both MATH140 Calculus I and MATH141 Calculus II. In addition, these students are encouraged to complete MATH240 Introduction to Linear Algebra because the material in this course provides a deeper understanding of finance. Students with an advanced math background will be in a better position to compete for admission to the Quantitative Finance Fellows and the Wall Street Fellows programs. In addition, this quantitative background will expand a student's career opportunities within finance.
