Minor in Second Language Education












TLPL







      Overview
  



The Minor in Second Language Education provides opportunities for undergraduate subject area majors to complete a sequence of courses that helps them prepare for careers as teachers of English to speakers of other languages (ESOL) in US schools and/or prepare them for roles as teachers of English as a foreign language (EFL) in international settings. If the undergraduate pursuing the minor desires to enter the ESOL teacher preparation track, the candidate may apply for the one year MCERT Program option. Completed courses in the minor that meet program requirements will be applied to the certification program requirements. 
The Minor in Second Language Education includes coursework from the Department of Teaching and Learning, Policy and Leadership (TLPL). The curriculum provides a foundation in second language learning and pedagogy, cross-cultural issues and understanding, and curricular and pedagogical issues that support reading and writing in a second language context. Several of the courses include field components that provide candidates with direct experience in working with second language learners. The minor incorporates coursework required for Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) certification from the Maryland State Department of Education.
