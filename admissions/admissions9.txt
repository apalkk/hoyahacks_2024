LEP Admission for Current Students






              Limited Enrollment Programs
            


Several majors at the University of Maryland (UMD) are considered Limited Enrollment Programs (LEP). These programs have limited space and, therefore, have more competitive admission criteria beyond the university’s general requirements. 
Students pursuing these majors may need to complete a series of "gateway requirements" specific to the major they are interested in. This can include completing certain courses, maintaining a specific GPA, etc.

      Applying to an LEP
    



    Prospective Students
  


Prospective students should indicate their preferred major when completing their online application for admission. However, your preferred major does not affect your admissibility to the university. Admitted students who selected an LEP as their major are reviewed by the specific program to determine admission to that major. 
While the majority of students are admitted to their preferred major, some LEP applicants may not be. Students who are admitted to UMD but not their preferred LEP major are placed in Letters & Sciences, where they will work with an advisor to meet the gateway requirements to earn admission to that major.
Admitted students who did not select an LEP major are admitted directly to the major indicated on their application. All major decisions are included in the applicant's admission decision letter.





    Current UMD Students
  


Current students, or internal transfers, who would like to change their major to an LEP must apply to do so.
