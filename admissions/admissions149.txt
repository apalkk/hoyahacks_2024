What is Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies?

Women, gender, and sexuality studies is an interdisciplinary field of inquiry analyzing structures of power, especially as they are grounded in gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity, nationality, ability and other inequalities, and as they configure historical and contemporary struggles for social change. The department and faculty at the University of Maryland enjoy a global reputation for innovative theoretical and methodological interventions and for their attention to curriculum transformation and global women, gender and sexuality studies institution building.
With a core faculty of eight and more than 80 affiliate faculty from across the campus, the department offers 5 ways for undergraduates to study with us in our 3 program areas: the bachelor and certificate in Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, the certificate and minor in LGBTQ Studies, and the minor Black Women's Studies.
