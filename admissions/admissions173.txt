Art Education, Bachelor of Arts (B.A.)

TLPL







      Overview
  



Double Major Program: Art Education / Studio Art
The University of Maryland’s Art Education Program is recognized for its intensive coursework and extensive applied learning designed to fully prepare future art educators for today’s diverse schools.
The Art Education / Studio Art Program embraces the artist-teacher concept which allows students to develop a strong studio practice while preparing to teach art at the P-12 level in today’s diverse schools.  It provides a solid foundation in the liberal arts as well as knowledge and specialized skills in studio arts, art history, educational best practices / teaching strategies, curriculum planning / writing and classroom management.  Thus, it creates a balance between the studio arts, art history, educational theory and best practice needs of successful future teachers.
We emphasize that our interns are the future leaders of their field and we’re preparing them to assume that  role immediately upon being hired! 
Under the supervision of faculty members, students receive pre-kindergarten through 12th grade (P-12) applied learning experiences in each art education course and also participate in an ‘After School Arts Program’ at a local school during the junior year.  In their senior year students become immersed in a Year Long Internship.  During the Fall Semester they have the opportunity to spend a designated time each week in assigned field placement schools - elementary and secondary - to get to know the school, their mentor, students, day-to-day teaching as well as curriculum and instructional duties.  During the Spring Semester they return to the same schools / mentors to ‘student- teach’ full time in each placement. 
The Year Long Internship experience is a most critical and valuable component of this teacher education program. It provides each candidate with an opportunity to gain the initial skills necessary to become an effective beginning art teacher as they observe, analyze, plan, teach, evaluate and reflect not only on their own teaching practice but also on their students’ learning.
