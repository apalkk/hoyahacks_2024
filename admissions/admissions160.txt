Undergraduate Minor





The department offers three different minor tracks for undergraduate students. These courses focus on the fundamentals of our field and while they may not afford students the breadth of curriculum in major degree programs, the coursework is usually sufficient to obtain a job in the field or admission to graduate school in the atmospheric and oceanic sciences. Students are also encouraged to pursue undergraduate research opportunities.
 


 














                               Tracks                             




Minor in Meteorology - for students who do not have an a prior interest to pursue graduate work in this field, but who might pursue careers where background in Meteorology is important, such as environmental policy, government, and industry.
Minor in Atmospheric Science - for nonmajors who might consider graduate work in atmospheric science, or prepare them for the very favorable job market in the Washington area where a background in Meteorology can be an important asset.
Minor in Atmospheric Chemistry - for students who might consider graduate work in atmospheric chemistry pursue careers where such a background is needed, such as air pollution, atmospheric chemistry and environmental issues.
Note: These minor tracks are not open to AOSC majors, students who major in physical sciences with a concentration in meteorology or who major in physics with a concentration in meteorology physics. 






                               Minor in Meteorology﻿                             




This Minor will provide the students with a general background in Meteorology as offered by the lower level courses, and a broader background on a wide range of sub-fields in Meteorology and on current issues in Climate Research, as provided by the two required courses. It is aimed at students who wish to be informed about this field, who do not have an a priori interest to pursue graduate work in this field, but who might pursue careers where background in Meteorology is important, such as environmental policy, government, and industry.
A total of 15 credits is required. All courses presented for the Minor must be passed with a grade of C- or better.
The students must choose two electives from:


AOSC 123 Causes and Implication of Global Change


AOSC 200 Weather and Climate


Any other 400 level course offered below as an elective


Two required courses:


AOSC 400 Physical Meteorology of the Atmosphere


AOSC 401 Global Environment


One additional elective from:
 


Any 400 level courses offered in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science on a regular basis or from a list of non-permanent electives that will be offered by Research Scientists, regular faculty from Meteorology, or members of the Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center (ESSIC)


Courses offered by the Departments of Geology and Geographical Sciences, such as:



GEOL 437 Global Climate Change: Past and Present


GEOL 452 Watershed and Wetland Hydrology


GEOG 446 Applied Climatology


GEOG 447 Advanced Biogeography


GEOG 472 Remote Sensing


 






                               Minor in Atmospheric Science﻿                             




This minor will provide a general background in meteorology as offered by the lower level courses, and a solid background in Atmospheric Physics (AOSC 431) and Atmospheric Dynamics (AOSC 432), as offered b two required courses. It is aimed at students that might consider graduate work in Meteorology, or prepare them for the very favorable job market in the Washington area, where a background in Meteorology can be an important asset. Students attempting this minor will need as strong background in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry at the level of MATH 240 or 461, PHYS 270 and PHYS 271; CHEM 131 or CHEM 135, which are prerequisites for the required courses.
A total of 15 credits is required. All courses presented for the Minor must be passed with a grade of C- or better.
The students must choose two electives from:
