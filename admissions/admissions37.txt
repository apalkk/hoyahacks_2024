              Transfer Merit Scholarships
            


If you are transferring to the University of Maryland, we offer scholarships tailored just for you!


Merit scholarships are offered to some of the University of Maryland’s most academically talented transfer students. Transfer applicants that apply by the March 1 fall early action deadline, are automatically reviewed for some of these merit scholarships, while others require a separate application. Only U.S. citizens and permanent residents can qualify for the university’s merit scholarships.
Students cannot appeal their merit scholarship decisions, and the university does not match scholarship offers from other institutions. Scholarships offered to admitted students who do not enroll at UMD cannot be disbursed to other students.




    Scholarship Eligibility
  


To be considered for merit scholarships, transfer students must submit a completed undergraduate admission application for the fall semester by the March 1 early action deadline. Students are only eligible to receive one merit scholarship. All merit scholarship decisions are based on academic and applicant information at the time of applying, not current or ongoing work. Additional eligibility requirements for each scholarship vary and can be found below.





    Frederick Douglass Scholarship
  


The Frederick Douglass Scholarship is a prestigious University of Maryland scholarship for academically talented transfer students from a Maryland community college. This exceptional academic scholarship honors the life and legacy of Frederick Douglass and requires a separate application.





    Maryland Transfer Scholarship
  


The Maryland Transfer Scholarship provides partial-tuition awards ranging from $5,000 distributed equally over two semesters to $10,000 distributed equally over four consecutive semesters.
Only in-state students transferring to the University of Maryland from a two-year or four-year institution are eligible. Students must apply for admission by the March 1 early action deadline and must submit the 2024-25 FAFSA by the priority deadline of March 1, 2024. No separate application is needed for consideration as recipients are identified on the basis of academic talent and demonstrated financial need. To maintain the scholarship, students must be enrolled full time beginning in the fall academic semester and maintain a cumulative grade point average of a 3.20. Each fall, roughly 200 Maryland Transfer Scholarship recipients are welcomed to campus.





    President's Transfer Scholarship
  


The President’s Transfer Scholarship provides funding for a maximum of two years to out-of-state transfer students enrolled at the University of Maryland. The annual award is in the amount of $5,000 and is determined through a competitive process based on academic talent. Only out-of-state applicants are eligible to receive the President’s Transfer Scholarship. No separate application is required for consideration, as recipients are identified through evaluation of admission application materials including academic achievement, extracurricular activities, awards, honors and an essay.





      Additional Scholarship Resources
    

We are committed to providing you with helpful information and resources that can assist in making a UMD education affordable for you and your family. Students admitted to UMD have the ability to find and apply for external scholarships through our scholarship matching tool, Scholarship Universe.Additionally, several academic departments offer merit scholarships to their most promising students. You should contact the department, college or school directly for information about availability, eligibility, applications and deadlines.
