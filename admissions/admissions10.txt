              LEP Admission for Current Students
            


Current students, or internal transfers, are students already at the University of Maryland (UMD) who would like to change their major to a Limited Enrollment Program (LEP). Processes differ depending on your major of interest.Students interested in Criminology & Criminal Justice or Psychology need to work directly with a department advisor and the College of Behavioral & Social Sciences, once the last required gateway course is completed.Students interested in any other LEP, need to apply following the process outlined below, which is managed by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.



      LEP Application Process
    

The LEP application is made available following the add/drop deadline of each semester. All applicants are strongly encouraged to review their program's gateway requirements prior to completing the application. 
Internal transfer students should complete the LEP application either during the semester in which they complete the required gateway courses or at the end of the semester. This timeline is dependent upon the application deadline for the student's preferred major.
Students applying for the fall semester can complete a gateway course during the summer, at either UMD or another institution. In order to be considered, courses must be taken during, or completed by the end of, UMD's Summer 1 Session. Students applying for the spring semester cannot complete gateway courses during the winter term.
Business applicants must complete all coursework by the conclusion of the fall or spring semester (summer coursework will not be reviewed). Only business applicants may submit letters of recommendation (no more than 3) via email to lep@umd.edu, or in-person to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions in the Mitchell Building.
