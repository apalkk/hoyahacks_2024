The Bioengineering curriculum is designed to emphasize strong fundamentals in both engineering and biology, to include experiential learning in the engineering practices, and to align with specific careers in bioengineering sub-fields. In the first two years, students take engineering foundation courses in biology, chemistry, physics, and math. In the third and fourth years, the focus shifts to the areas of career-specific areas, including biotechnology, biomechanics, biomaterials, and biomedical instrumentation. Capstone I and II is a two-semester fall/spring sequence taken in the fourth year that provides an immersion experience in entrepreneurialism, innovation, and the engineering practice.
Prospective StudentsCurrent students















Students are expected to maintain timely progress towards degree completion and satisfactory academic performance as defined by the A. James Clark School of Engineering and the department.  For more information on academic progress, including the 45-credit review, please see  https://eng.umd.edu/advising/academic-policies.
 
The undergraduate program is designed to be completed in four years.  The sample plan below is an important guide for students, as good planning is important for timely graduation with a degree in a rigorous engineering program. It should be noted that students entering the program with AP credits may benefit from added flexibility. A separate sample plan for those following the pre-health track is also available.
 
Questions about the undergraduate program in bioengineering may be sent to bioe-undergrad@umd.edu.
