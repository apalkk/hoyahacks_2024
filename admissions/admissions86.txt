Programs of Study



Plant Biology






The Plant Biology Program is intended as a preparatory curriculum that will qualify our graduates for postgraduate study in any aspect of Plant Biology. Whether the student is interested in working in the rapidly developing field of agricultural biotechnology or wishes to academically contribute to the creation of new knowledge in the plant sciences, this is the option that should be chosen.

Turf & Golf Course Management






The Turf and Golf Course Management Program at the University of Maryland provides students with the broad based skills needed to succeed as a practicing turfgrass professional. The program focuses on golf turf management but also has been designed to expose students to all segments of the turfgrass industry.

Urban Forestry






Urban Forestry is managing our green infrastructure, by planting and maintaining trees in neighborhoods, open space, parks, and urban landscapes, protecting forests and trees during land development, beautifying roadsides, public properties, and cities. The Urban Forestry Program at the University of Maryland offers the education and training to become an urban forester or continue studies in graduate programs in forestry and other related areas.
