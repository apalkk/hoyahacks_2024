¹ Notwithstanding any other provision of this or any university publication, the university reserves the right to make changes in tuition, fees and other charges at any time such changes are deemed necessary by the University System of Maryland Board of Regents. Although changes in tuition, fees and charges ordinarily will be announced in advance, the university reserves the right to make such changes without prior announcement.² Only students pursuing a major in business, engineering and computer science will be charged additional tuition based on credit hours. Get additional information and a breakdown of these charges on the Differential Tuition FAQs page.³ International students may experience higher living expenses. UMD charges a fee of $125 each semester for enrolled students requiring an I-20 or DS-2019 (for degree seeking students in J-1 status) issued by the University. Students enrolled in an academic program operating on the 12-week calendar, who require an I-20 or DS-2019 issued by UMD, will be charged a fee of $62.50 per term. UMD will use the revenue from this fee to enhance support for our international students to include improved academic support, expanded assistance for students transitioning to the U.S. and international student-focused cultural events to foster an engaged, supportive community.⁴ Costs for housing and dining can vary depending on whether a student lives on- or off-campus, and the level of food plan they choose from Dining Services.⁵ These figures are averages and will vary from student to student. They are not billed by the university.
