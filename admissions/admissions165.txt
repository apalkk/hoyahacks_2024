Undergraduate Minors in Geology


An Undergraduate Minor recognizes concentrated study in a designated field in the College of Computer, Mathematical, and Physical Sciences. The awarding of a Minor will be noted on the student's transcript at the time of graduation. 
The following minors may be earned within the Geology Department by students not majoring in Geology (unless otherwise indicated). A grade of "C-" or better must be earned in all courses required for the minor, and a minimum 2.0 grade point average must be earned for in all courses required for the minor. Although we suggest minors that may be broadly compatible for students of particular majors, students in any University program may work toward any of the Geology minors. Aspects of Geology minor coursework are negotiable: contact the Undergraduate Director for details.
