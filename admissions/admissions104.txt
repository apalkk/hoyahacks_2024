About the Chinese Program
The Chinese major provides the training and cultural background needed for entering East Asia-related careers in such fields as higher education, the arts, business, government, international relations, agriculture, or the media. Students may also consider a double major in Chinese and another discipline, such as business, international relations, economics, or journalism.
Our two Chinese minors provide more skeletal training in Chinese language or culture.
Our Chinese majors and minors have won 60 national scholarships since 2009, including 21 Gilman, 11 Fulbright, five Boren, four Freeman Asia, and one NSF.
