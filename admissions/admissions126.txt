About LACS Undergraduate Programs
The Undergraduate Certificate strengthens the intellectual breadth and depth of Maryland students, especially those majoring in fields that are identified as possessing particular importance for the State of Maryland, such as STEAM, multilingualism, multicultural education, healthcare, and sustainability. The Certificate nurtures a globally-conscious citizenry and grows a well-trained, professional workforce prepared to succeed in areas such as international business and finance, marketing, communications, ecological and environmental studies, government and diplomacy, law, development, education, literary arts and cultural expression.
The Latin American and Caribbean Studies Certificate program and its extracurricular events help attract a highly diverse student body to the University of Maryland, and attract an equally diverse faculty who are singularly active in developing and promoting campus diversity. LACS functions as a dynamic and supportive community, in which each participant (undergraduate, graduate student, faculty, staff, public) is a crucial component of the whole.
