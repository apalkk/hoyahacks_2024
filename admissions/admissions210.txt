Bachelor's Degree
For General Education requirements, consult the current Undergraduate Catalog. Transfer students, please see the General Education Transfer Policy. 
Students are required to earn a minimum of 122 credits. Accredited journalism programs require majors to complete successfully approximately two-thirds of their coursework in areas other than journalism and communication. The Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland adheres to this nationwide policy. In practical terms, this means that of the 122 minimum credits required for graduation, a journalism student must take 42 credits in journalism (numbered 100 or above). Of the remaining 80 credits, a minimum of 65 must be earned in liberal-arts designated courses.
The Philip Merrill College of Journalism stipulates that 57 of the total credits must be taken in upper-level courses (courses numbered 300-499).
These courses are required for all journalism majors, regardless of whether journalism is a student’s primary or secondary major:
