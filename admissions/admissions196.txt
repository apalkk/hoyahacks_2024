	About Electrical Engineering
Electrical engineers create innovative technology solutions in a wide range of areas from handheld communications to solar panels; from cardiac pacemakers to autonomous robots; from wireless networks to bio-engineered sensors that detect dangerous pathogens; and intelligent surveillance systems that perform face and motion recognition. Employers visiting campus seek out electrical engineering students for recruitment more than any other major at the University of Maryland.

	Electrical Engineering Curriculum
The Electrical Engineering curriculum requires a minimum of 120 credits to degree completion. Undergraduate students pursue a common foundation in math, physics, chemistry, and an introduction to engineering design and programming.  Sophomores and juniors will concentrate on the electrical engineering core curriculum and seniors will choose from a wide variety of electrical engineering elective courses from the following sub-disciplines:

		Communications and Signal Processing

		Computer Engineering

		Electrophysics

		Microelectronics

		Power Systems

		Controls
During senior year, students will also complete a capstone design course that integrates classroom learning with hands-on practical design. Students thereby gain valuable technical skills for subsequent graduate study and/or technical advancement.
	Due to the similarity in curriculum, students in Electrical Engineering are not allowed to earn a second major or degree in Computer Engineering.
