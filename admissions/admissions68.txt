Undergraduate Catalog

Welcome to the University of Maryland Undergraduate Catalog. The Undergraduate Catalog provides information pertaining to undergraduate academic programs, including course descriptions and program requirements, and sets forth the university's academic, registration and graduation policies and regulations. A listing of University of Maryland policies and procedures is available at http://president.umd.edu/policies/. Program requirements contained in the Undergraduate Catalog supersede any information which may be contained in any bulletin of any school or department. This Undergraduate Catalog also contains hyperlinks to other informational resources at the University of Maryland. The information contained in these hyperlinks is provided as a convenience to the reader and is not part of the Undergraduate Catalog itself.
The provisions of the Undergraduate Catalog are not to be regarded as a contract between the student and the University of Maryland. The university reserves the right to change its policies, rules, regulations, requirements for graduation, course offerings, tuition, fees, other charges, or any other contents of this catalog at any time.
Changes are effected from time to time in the general policies, and academic and graduation requirements. The Undergraduate Catalog will be updated to reflect such changes, as appropriate, but updates may not appear immediately. There are established procedures for making changes that protect the institution's integrity and the individual student's interest and welfare. A curriculum or graduation requirement, when altered, is not normally retroactive unless the change is to the students' advantage and can be accommodated within the span of years normally required for graduation.
Registration Guide: The registration guide outlines registration dates and procedures, and provides information on deadlines, fees, and other student services at the university. The registration guide and schedule of classes are available at https://registrar.umd.edu.
