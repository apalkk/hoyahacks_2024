Nutrition & Food Science






The Department of Nutrition and Food Science (NFSC) in the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources offers two undergraduate majors for students who would like to pursue challenging careers in the growing field of food and nutrition. The program offers a Bachelor of Science degree in Fermentation Science and Nutrition and Food Science with three options for students interested in nutritional science, food science, and dietetics.
The Department of Nutrition and Food Science strives to prepare students for careers in the dynamic and global food industry, public health and community nutrition sectors, health care, or biomedical research. NFSC houses the University of Maryland College Park Dietetic Internship, as well as interdepartmental graduate programs in both Food Science and Nutrition.
Degrees Offered: B.S., M.S., and Ph.D.

Programs of Study



Nutritional Science






The Nutritional Science concentration (formerly known as Human Nutrition and Foods) focuses on the physiological and biological aspects of foods and nutrients. Opportunities for nutritional scientists include research positions in laboratories, hospitals, and industry. This option prepares students for graduate study. The program also meets premedical and pre-dental requirements.
Nutritional Science information





Food Science






The Food Science concentration prepares students to apply the principles of science and engineering to better understand the complex and heterogeneous materials recognized as food. There is a great demand in the global food industry and government for highly knowledgeable and competent food scientists. Opportunities for food scientists include food safety, food quality control, food product development, production management, technical sales and service, ingredient management, research, and teaching. This option also prepares students for graduate study.
Food Science information





Dietetics






The Dietetics concentration prepares students to apply their knowledge of nutrition to promote healthy eating patterns in the population. Registered Dietitians (RDs) work in many areas including clinical and community nutrition, nutrition counseling, nutrition education and research, wellness, government, public health, food service management and others. The dynamic field of Dietetics is ever growing and dietitians continue to find new and different ways to communicate nutrition information to the public. This option also prepares students for medical and dental school, as well as graduate study in a variety of fields.
Dietetics information





Fermentation Science



Fermentation Science will prepare students for workforce demand of the broadly defined fermentation industries that include beverages (beer, wine, distilled spirits and kombucha), vegetable foods (kimchi, tempeh and miso), dairy foods (cheese and yogurt) and biotechnology industries (biofuels and pharmaceuticals). In addition to general education courses, students will take core required courses on fermentation science and participate in industrial internships for practical experiences and experiential learning with fermentation industries and possible placement in those companies.
