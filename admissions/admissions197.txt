About the FPE Program
Fire Protection Engineering offers a variety of excellent career opportunities, covering a wide spectrum of safety assessment reviews, hazards analysis and research, loss prevention and regulatory issues.
Each FPE student receives a fundamental engineering education involving the subjects of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The program builds on other core engineering subjects of materials, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics and heat transfer with emphasis on principles and phenomena related to fire. Fluid mechanics includes applications to sprinkler design, suppression systems, and smoke movement. Heat transfer introduces the student to principles of evaporation for liquid fuels. The subject of combustion is introduced involving premixed and diffusion flames, ignition and flame spread, and burning processes. Laboratory experience is gained by being exposed to standard fire tests and measurements. Design procedures are emphasized for systems involving suppression, detection, alarm, and building safety requirements. The background and application of codes and standards are studied to prepare the student for practice in the field. System concepts of fire safety and methods of analysis are presented. A senior design or research project is required which gives the student an opportunity to explore issues beyond the normal classroom environment.
