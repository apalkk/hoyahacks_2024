About 
The Immersive Media Design program strives to represent the University of Maryland's vision of an academic "STEAM" community--science and technology resolutely joined with the creative and performing arts. Immersive Media Design does this by requiring students to be conversant in both the technical and creative sides of immersive media.





What is Immersive Media?
Immersive media engages the viewer with sight, sound and other sensory experiencesâ€”encouraging people to interact with the digital environment that surrounds them. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are two prevalent examples of immersive media, yet the discipline can also be presented through projected displays, as well as tactile or audio platforms.






Distinctive Features

Immersive Media Design features a coordinated series of studio lab courses across all years where students will collaborate as teams on substantial creative projects preparing students for the collaborative nature of modern workspaces.
Team teaching by faculty members from art and computer science in studio lab courses strengthens the integrative and collaborative nature of the program.
Immersive Media Design combines the creative use of media software tools with an understanding of how to design and build them.
Students engaged in this major can take advantage of immersive media-driven research and scholarship already underway at the University of Maryland including our groundbreaking work in virtual and augmented reality in the Maryland Blended Reality Center. It also involves bold and innovative digital artwork by our faculty on display in regional and international galleries.
