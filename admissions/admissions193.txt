CEE Electives


Students must consult with an advisor on selection of appropriate courses for their particular course of study.


 
Degree Tracks
By their junior year, each student must choose between three specialization tracks that specify junior- and senior-level requirements. 


Environmental & Water Resources


This track is designed for those students who wish to specialize in water and environmental engineering domains. An emphasis is placed on environmental chemistry, potable and wastewater treatment, bioengineering, and hydrologic/hydraulic engineering. Students who complete this track will be well prepared for entry level positions in industry or for graduate level work.
