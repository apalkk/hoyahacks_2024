The Biological Sciences Undergraduate Program













Over 1,500 students are enrolled in the Biological Sciences major at the University of Maryland, College Park each year. The Biological Sciences undergraduate program is coordinated by the Departments of Biology, Cell Biology & Molecular Genetics, and Entomology and is administered by the College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences.The Biological Sciences major (BSCI) exposes students to the modern experimental disciplines within biology and prepares them for diverse careers in health care, research, policy and academia. Students who major in Biological Sciences can pick one of the following specializations:General BiologyCell Biology and GeneticsEcology and EvolutionMicrobiologyPhysiology and NeurobiologyIndividualized StudiesStudents enrolled in the Biological Sciences major will learn the foundations and applications of biology across multiple levels of its organization from molecules to ecosystems. Fundamental principles learned in the introductory course sequence will be reinforced, deepened, and applied in upper-level courses. Biological science seeks mechanistic explanations of life by integrating mathematical, physical, and chemical concepts to understand how living organisms work. Mechanistic and quantitative understanding will be stressed at each level of the curriculum. Modern biology is an experimental science. Scientists ask questions about the natural world and design experiments involving various model systems to generate data that can be analyzed to answer the questions. An understanding of the methods of science will be stressed across the curriculum.    Students in the Biological Sciences program receive personal attention, high-quality advising, and numerous on- and off-campus research and internship opportunities.
