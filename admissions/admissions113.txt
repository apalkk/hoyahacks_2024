Beyond the Classroom




Students who major in French will not only develop knowledge of the French language, but also discover the literary and artistic traditions of French-speaking cultures from around the world. 
The French faculty at UMD includes internationally recognized specialists in French and Francophone literature, linguistics and cinema from the Early Modern period to the present. Through individualized curricula, students can shape their degrees according to their personal interests, while cultivating global competency and critical thinking. Students can also develop professional skills in French, including business French, diplomacy, French for medical purposes, etc. with our French for the professions courses.
Each semester, we offer a wide range of courses, with many taught exclusively in French. The French major includes opportunities to study abroad, participate in a unique immersive experience with the Language House Living & Learning Residential Program, practice one-on-one with a native speaker through the Language Partner Program and many more opportunities to experience culture from the French-speaking world. Undergraduate majors have gone on to successful careers in a range of fields, including law, journalism, international relations, civil service and teaching in France, while others have continued to study at the graduate level.

Interested in Declaring a French Major?
To add the French major, your first step is to meet with the French undergraduate advisor. Email hwegmann@umd.edu and set up an appointment.
At the appointment, the advisor will review major requirements, discuss any credits you may already have completed and help you map out a plan to complete the French major by your target graduation date. The French advisor will then provide you with the appropriate forms to submit to the College of Arts and Humanities to officially declare your major.
