Bachelor of Arts in Real Estate and the Built Environment 



 






Image
 





The Bachelor of Arts in Real Estate and the Built Environment expands the traditional, narrowly focused, business approach to real estate, finance, investment and management, providing students with broad perspectives that come from the multitude of disciplines that make up the modern practice of real estate. From construction methods and materials to politics and public policy, and from urban planning and design, to transportation, to building and landscape architecture, modern real estate development is a multi-disciplinary practice. The major offers a set of required courses to introduce students to the complexity of real estate and the built environment practice, as well electives in the affiliated fields that impact the Built Environment. The focus is on transformational real estate practice, addressing issues posed by individual and collective decisions about the built environment ranging from social and environmental justice, to climate change, to community identity and heritage.

Change of Major Workshop




Major changes in an academic program can lead to an increase in the timeline to completion due to the sequential nature of courses. Students typically will have to take a different set of courses that are specific to their new program of study. Many of these courses may have prerequisites, which means that they must be taken in a particular sequence.
Some courses may only be offered during certain semesters or academic years, which can further prolong the timeline to completion. If a student misses a required course due to scheduling conflicts or availability issues, they may have to wait an entire year before they can take the course and continue with their studies.
