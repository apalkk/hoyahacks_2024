The 15-credit Italian language and culture minor provides an overview of the linguistic, cultural, and literary aspects of Italian.
Minors in the College of Arts and Humanities offer students in all disciplines the opportunity to pursue an in-depth, structured program of study in a field outside of their major. Minors allow participants to earn official recognition for their expertise and achievements, broadening their skills and interests and giving them an edge in today’s competitive job markets.
