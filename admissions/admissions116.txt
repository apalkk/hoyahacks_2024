Minors











This minor has two tracks:  one in ancient and one in modern Greek. 
















Both tracks have the same basic requirements, but the language courses must all be taken either in ancient or in modern Greek, not a combination.  Students may begin at the beginning or may be placed in the appropriate level if they have studied Greek elsewhere or spoken it in their families. This minor requires a minimum of 15 credits, 9 of which must be at the 300 or 400 level.  At least one of the upper-level courses must have the GREK prefix.  One or two of the upper-level courses may have the CLAS prefix; these are literature and culture courses taught in English translation.  A student who has never studied Greek before will start with the introductory courses and will need extra credits to complete the minor.          
No course grade below the grade of C- may count toward the minor. An overall GPA of 2.0 in the minor is required for graduation.  A maximum of 6 credits may be counted toward the minor as well as toward a major.
