BACHELOR OF MUSIC






Breadcrumb


Home











The Bachelor of Music (B.M.) degree is designed for undergraduate students who desire a professional and career-focused education in music.
















Available with an emphasis in either composition, jazz, piano, strings, theory, voice or winds and percussion, the B.M. allows students to study with our renowned performance faculty, play in many of our top ensembles and take part in our innovative music history and theory curriculum. With approximately 60 percent of your studies devoted to music, the B.M. provides professional-level training alongside a school-wide commitment to diversity, community engagement and entrepreneurship. With a B.M., you will be well-prepared to embark on an innovative musical career or enter the nation’s top graduate programs. While challenging, it is possible to pursue the B.M. and another major (many of our B.M. students also earn Bachelor of Music Education by completing an additional semester).
