With skills of reading, writing, listening, speaking and cultural understanding, they will be prepared to perform a diversity of language tasks, from analyzing Israeli literature and film, writing essays and understanding news broadcasts to writing informal emails or text messages and speaking with native speakers. Students will become aware of Israeli cultural norms, and this knowledge will allow them to decide which words and communication style are appropriate so they can move easily between language settings.
The Hebrew Studies minor is administered by the School of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures.
