Minor in Entomology






Entomology represents the study of insects at all levels of biological hierarchy, from genes to ecosystems, as well as the ecological and evolutionary processes that sustain them. Beneficial insects, like pollinators, natural enemies, and decomposers play important roles in maintaining sustainable conditions through their contribution to ecosystem services. In contrast, injurious insects cause harm to our health, our agriculture, and our structures, requiring their management in appropriate ways for the protection of society without harming biodiversity. Many disciplines use insects as model systems for study, including genetics, cell biology, evolution, population ecology, conservation biology, engineering, and education. Entomology combines fundamental and mission-based research across campus. Many insect species and their relatives (e.g., spiders and crustaceans) are the subjects of study within labs that employ undergraduates. Employed students may wish to complement their work with a structured exposure to the discipline of entomology. In addition, students that are performing internship or independent research in Entomology labs, e.g., through the Entomology Honors Program or BSCI 389 “Entomology Department Research,” may wish to add the minor to their academic program.  Finally, insects are increasingly valued for their ecosystem services, leading to the need for training specifically in entomology to complement a student’s major. The goal of the Entomology minor is to prepare students with interest in insects as models for future research and education, as well as to expose students to the broader impacts of insects in nature and society.






​About the minor
The Entomology minor provides students with a broad understanding of the form and function of insects, their interactions with people and society, and their role as model species for fundamental and applied research. It is intended for students with an interest in insects and their relatives, whether from professional or avocational perspectives. In addition to the Biological Sciences, the minor is especially applicable to students with majors in Environmental Science and Policy, Plant Sciences and Landscape Architecture, and Environmental Science and Technology. Students from a wide range of majors may be interested in incorporating entomology with their majors. The organization of the minor includes a general course in entomology, an upper level course related to advanced entomology, as well as courses from at least two specialized fields of science: advanced biology, pollination biology, plant sciences, and environmental sciences.
Learning outcomes
Students completing the requirements for the Minor in Entomology will:Develop a solid foundation on the structure and function of insects and their relatives within an evolutionary context, including the ability to identify orders and common families of arthropods.Comprehend the diversity of insect species and their ecological roles leading to beneficial and injurious effects on human society and economy.Understand and apply the use of insects as models for scientific endeavors, such as developmental biology, genetics, pest management, and population ecology.Integrate knowledge of insects within a specialized field of science.Understand the need to conserve and restore populations of insects in response to global issues such as biodiversity loss, climate change, food security, and invasive species.
Courses required for the proposed minor
The minor requires a minimum of 15 course credits, with at least 9 credits at the upper level.  No more than six credits (or two courses) may be applied to satisfy both the requirements of a minor and a major program. Courses from the A, B, and C categories may be selected in any order, subject to prerequisites. Depending on the optional courses, a total of 15-17 credits are required. All courses presented for the minor must be passed with a grade of C- or better. We require advising when the student has first entered the minor, as well as during the semester before their last semester that they plan to graduate. The first advising meeting will ensure the student understands the requirements of the minor and the restrictions on the number of overlapping credits with their major. The second advising meeting ensures that courses are correctly assigned to their major and minor.
