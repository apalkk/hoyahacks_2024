Examine the complexities and conflicts in meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to do the same by minoring in Sustainability.

  Study Abroad

    


Experiential learning is an important part of the Sustainability Studies minor, which is why we have approved several study abroad courses for the minor. Studying abroad is a great, unique way to get hands-on experience and deepen your understanding of sustainability and what it means to different people and cultures around the world.
The Education Abroad Office has a list of all study abroad opportunities available on campus. Many of these study abroad trips can be used for the Sustainability Studies Minor. New programs are available every year, so keep your eyes open, and if you see a trip that fits your interests, let us know. We will work with you to get the most out of your time abroad.
Contact us at susminor@umd.edu if you are interested in studying abroad for the minor. All courses must be pre-approved by the Sustainability Studies office for the course to count towards the completion of the minor.





        
  Frequently Asked Questions

    


What is Sustainability?
In 1987, the Brundtland Commission of the United Nations defined sustainable development as “Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”. As sustainability professionals, we work to enact effective change within our disciplines and organizations to align with this development mindset. Our curriculum explores the many ways human activity supports or conflicts with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, as well as how we can more broadly embrace the Triple Bottom Line of social, economic, and ecological sustainability.
What can I do with a minor in Sustainability Studies?
Minors come from all different academic backgrounds, each pursuing their own professional and career goals. Fortunately, more sectors and disciplines are incorporating sustainability each year, and recognize the value of applicants with this background. Emerging fields include agriculture, architecture, business and economics, education, energy, wilderness conservation, and urban planning. The list doesn’t end there - tailor your studies to suit your interests!
