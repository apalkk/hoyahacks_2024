LEP Guidelines







The following guidelines pertain to all Limited Enrollment Programs:
				
Only one gateway or performance review course may be repeated to earn the required grade and that course may only be repeated once. When more than one course can satisfy a gateway requirement, taking a second course from the list will count as a repeat. Please note that a grade of "W" is considered an attempt and must be repeated.
Students may apply once to an LEP.
Students who were directly admitted and fail to meet the performance review criteria will be dismissed from the major and may not reapply.
Students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00 after admission to an LEP. Failure to do so will result in dismissal from the major.
Any student denied admission or dismissed from the major may appeal in writing to the individual LEP.






Students directly admitted to LEP major upon freshman admission




Freshmen who were accepted to a University of Maryland Limited Enrollment Program must complete a series of courses, or Gateways, and earn a minimum grade point average in order to remain in the major. Please select your current major from the drop down list in order to see the requirements of your major.
