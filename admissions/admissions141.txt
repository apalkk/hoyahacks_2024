The Minor in Religious Studies is an 18-credit course of study that provides students with the opportunity to learn about religion in cross-cultural and trans-historical perspectives.
A core course introduces students to the study of world religions, while other courses range widely in their focus, allowing students to learn more about sacred texts, traditions, practices, philosophies, and material culture. Courses may focus on a single religious tradition, a region or period of history, or a concentrated approach to the analysis of religion and religious culture. Courses for the minor are drawn from such departments and programs as Anthropology, Art History and Archaeology, Classics, Government and Politics, History, Honors, Jewish Studies, Philosophy, and Women's Studies.
