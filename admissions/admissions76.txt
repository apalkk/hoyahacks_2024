AGNR Certificates






The Institute of Applied Agriculture (IAA) seeks to enroll students who demonstrate the potential for academic success, which is assessed by examination of high school and/or previous college coursework and the results of standardized tests. Admission to the IAA is granted without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, gender, or disability. Apply by January 5 for Spring admission and August 5 for Fall admission.
Apply Today


Admission Requirements



High School Records



To be admitted into the IAA, students must be high school graduates or have the equivalent documentation. The IAA must receive an official high school transcript with verification of graduation. Admission prior to graduation from high school will be conditional until the student completes the high school curriculum and has a final official transcript sent to UMD.





Standardized Tests



Through the Fall 2023 semester, applicants may opt not to submit results from either the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) or the American College Test (ACT).
If you have taken the SAT or ACT, please send your scores directly to UMD. The code to submit SAT scores is 5814. The code to submit ACT scores is 1746.





Previous College Records



Students with prior college experience are to submit transcripts from all postsecondary institutions attended. College transcripts will be reviewed for admission purposes and transfer course credit. College transcripts take precedence over high school transcripts in determining admission. 





Additional Criteria



Standardized test scores and grade-point averages (GPA) on selected courses will be used to help determine the applicant's potential for academic success, but they are not the sole factors in deciding the applicant's admissibility. Personal interviews and letters of recommendation may also be considered.





Agriculture Forward at Maryland



To be considered for Ag Forward, applicants must:
Be a first-time college student.
Have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 upon graduation from high school.
Earn a minimum score of 500 on both the Math and Critical Reading portions of the SAT, or an equivalent score on the ACT.
Possess U.S. citizenship or permanent resident status.
Submit an application for admission to the IAA by March 15.






When to Apply



Students may apply any time after they have completed their junior year of high school. Apply by January 5 for Spring admission and August 5 for Fall admission to our certificate programs. For Ag Forward, applications are due on March 15.
