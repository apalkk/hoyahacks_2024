Global Poverty Minor


Education Abroad


All Undergraduate Courses





















The Global Poverty minor develops an awareness and understanding of the dimensions of global poverty, its causes and consequences, and the scope of policies aimed at poverty alleviation.  

Students will discover how incentives, resources, and social and political institutions influence the incidence of poverty across and within countries.  Students in the minor will explore the relationships between poverty and determinants of human welfare such as hunger, health, education and environmental quality. 
We welcome students of all majors to declare this as a minor.
The minor is supported by a student run advisory board. Follow their Instagram account @umdglobal


Declaring the Minor

You must declare a minor no later than one full academic year before graduation.
If you would like to enroll in the minor, please fill out an interest form (including a signature from your major college) and e-mail Maria Soppelsa to schedule an advising appointment.

Important Notes

- Students who declared the Global Poverty minor in Spring 2018 or before may use GEOG 130 to satisfy the Global Studies Signature/Perspectives course requirement. GEOG 130 will only count as an elective and NOT a Global Studies Perspectives course for students who declare Fall 2018 and after.
- A maximum of two (2) courses total can be below the 300-level.
- A maximum of one (1) experiential learning course (internship or study abroad) can count towards the Global Poverty minor.
- Many of these courses listed require prerequisites. It is the student's responsibility to ensure familiarity with pre-requisites for a course.
- Other courses can be considered as electives with advisor approval.
