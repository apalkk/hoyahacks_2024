About The Arabic Program
The Arabic Flagship Program at UMD is an integral part of the Arabic program. It welcomes UMD students from any major who wish to achieve superior-level proficiency in Arabic (both formal register and at least one dialect) and intercultural fluency. In addition to a rigorous academic program, Flagship students take part in a variety of extracurricular activities, an individual tutoring program, internships and other professional opportunities. Participation in the Arabic Flagship includes a capstone year in Meknes, Morocco. 










Advising and Courses



Advising


The Arabic Program undergraduate advisor is available for consultation about any aspect of your study of Arabic. We recommend that every Arabic major confer with the program advisor at registration time each semester.
For Arabic advising, email Ahmed Hanafy | 3138 H.J. Patterson Hall | ahmeda@umd.edu
The College of Arts and Humanities (ARHU) Office of Student Affairs provides college advising for all ARHU undergraduates in 1120 Francis Scott Key Hall.
