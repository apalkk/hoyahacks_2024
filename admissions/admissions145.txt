Courses for Heritage Speakers


The Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers several courses specifically designed for Spanish heritage learners. 
Spanish heritage learners are students who have a linguistic and cultural connection with the Spanish language. This may be because they come from homes where Spanish is spoken, their heritage is linked to a country or area where Spanish is spoken or they live or have lived in a community that speaks Spanish. 
The courses we offer recognize the diverse cultural and linguistic profiles of our students. Our classes can accommodate students who are exposed to Spanish-speaking environments in a variety of social and/or professional environments but understand or speak little Spanish. We can also help Spanish heritage learners who seek to strengthen their skills in professional or academic registers of Spanish. In general, our goal is to help students develop their Spanish skills so they feel more confident when using Spanish in different contexts. 
Our courses for Spanish heritage learners focus on strengthening and expanding students’ communicative competence in a variety of contexts and texts and fostering an appreciation for and understanding of the cultural and linguistic diversity of the Spanish-speaking world, including the United States. 
The department also offers a minor in heritage language and Latina/o culture. See here for more information on these courses.
The specific goals for each course are:

SPAN206 (Oral and Written Spanish for Native Speakers Educated in the US) identifies and expands the students’ bilingual range through intensive grammar review, vocabulary building, spelling and punctuation, and the development of advanced composition skills.
SPAN306 (Spanish II for Native Speakers) expands the students’ knowledge of Spanish through readings, written essays, and oral presentations. At the end of the course, students present small research projects on different aspects and issues related to the linguistic and cultural variation of local Latina/o communities.
SPAN307 (Oral Communication Skills for Native Speakers of Spanish) focuses on the development of techniques for public speaking in Spanish in a variety of contexts: organizing and presenting information, using rhetorical patterns for informative and persuasive goals, reducing speech anxiety and becoming aware of voice and body for clear and successful presentations in Spanish.
SPAN206, 306 and 307 often incorporate service learning components, whereby students conduct projects in local Latina/o communities, schools, and organizations. Another course, Spanish 386: Experiential Learning, coordinates opportunities for Spanish majors wishing to do internships, volunteer work, and research projects in Latina/o communities.

The department has had an FTE (a permanent position or line) in U.S. Latina/o/x literatures since 1998, one of the first departments in the mid-Atlantic region to open such a position in a Spanish department. Students who take Latino classes in Spanish include native Spanish speakers and heritage speakers from the U.S. and elsewhere, and new learners of the Spanish language. Discussions in U.S. Latino classes tend to be less corrective but enriched by the linguistic capacities and experiences of students.
