Room Layouts & Tours








We offer a broad range of room styles - from traditional residence halls to apartments and suites - to help students live comfortably and thrive in their new community.
The majority of rooms in the residence halls are doubles (shared by two students). First-year students may also choose between triples or quad rooms while returning residents typically live in single rooms, apartments, or suites.
Our residence hall rooms are furnished with:

Twin size bed and mattress (Johnson-Whittle and Pyon-Chen Halls have XL twin bed frames)
Five-drawer dresser (except Oakland Hall and Prince Frederick Hall, which have three-drawer dressers)
Desk with drawer and shelf; desk chair
Personal data line

Each room also has window blinds, shared closet space, a smoke alarm, a fire suppression sprinkler, and an overhead light.
Explore our room layouts and take a virtual 360º tour of our residence halls to imagine yourself in your future home.
Please note that room layout and furniture may vary by building and room. Furniture in some rooms may also be reconfigured to meet student needs.










Double Room
Double rooms include two beds, two dressers, two desks, and two chairs. You will share a double room with a roommate.

Apartments & Suites
Apartments and suites give students the independence that comes from living off campus, with the added benefit of being centrally located right on campus! Apartments and suites range from 3-5 bedrooms and 1-2 baths. They include furnished living rooms and bedrooms and can house up to 8 students. Additionally, apartments have a fully equipped kitchen and dining room. Laundry facilities are available centrally within the community.
