Bachelor of Science



Materials Science and Engineering is a multidisciplinary field focused on developing materials, devices and systems that provide the foundation for advancing technology.
















Materials Science and Engineering Program
Requirements for the MSE major include thorough preparation in mathematics, chemistry, physics, and engineering science as well as the required university general education requirements. All students will be required to select an area of specialization, an upper-class science elective, and two technical electives. A minimum of 122 credits is required for a bachelor's degree.
 




MSE Specialization Areas
Materials Science and Engineering students are required to select a specialization area to increase their depth of knowledge in one aspect of MSE. In this topical area, they will take five upper level (junior/senior) classes, of which at least four must be ENMA classes. Classes offered by other departments with cross listed ENMA sections such as PHYS 499M (ENMA 489X): Physics, Material Chemistry and Device Applications at the Nanoscale and CHBE 473 (ENMA 499C): Electrochemical Energy Engineering may be used as specialization electives with advisor approval.
The identified specializations are Materials Science, Soft Materials and Biomaterials, Materials for Applications, and Materials for Energy. With their advisor’s approval, students may design a specialization area to meet individual career and academic goals. The five classes may be ENMA electives or other upper level engineering classes. The choice and sequence of specialization electives is discussed with, and approved by, the student’s academic advisor. The specialization electives must make sense as a package in terms of the individual student’s academic and career goals. The choice of specialization area allows the student significant flexibility in choosing her or his envisioned career path. Representative elective classes, which may be taken as specialization electives, include:
